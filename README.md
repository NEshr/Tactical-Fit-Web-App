# Tactical-Fit-Web-App
Capstone Project

This is a fitness app based on a routine found in the series "Tactical Barbell(TB)". For those unfamiliar, a typical TB
routine would feature workouts that look similar to the following, focusing on just two exercise to illustrate:

Week 1: Mon, Fri: Bench 4x8 @ 70% of 1 Rep Max, Deadlift 4x5 @ 70% of 1 Rep Max      *1 Rep Max = Weight you can lift one time
Week 2: Mon, Fri: Bench 4x6 @ 80% of 1 Rep Max, Deadlift 4x4 @ 80% of 1 Rep Max
Week 3: Mon, Fri: Bench 4x4 @ 90% of 1 Rep Max, Deadlift 4x3 @ 90% of 1 Rep Max

TB rotuines entail 3 or more exercises which can be at different set and rep schemes and where the weight to be lifted will
change based on what week one is on in the routine. 

Given the number of things to keep track of, I wanted an app that could automatically implement the TB routine 
of your choice(only one is available at the moment).

As such, this app can do the following:

     Calculate your one rep max and all pertinent percentages
     Track your schedule, letting you know when your next workout day is.
     Tell you which exercises, weights, sets and reps you are to do on any given workout day
     Allow you to progress by incrementing your rep max based on difficulty
     Gives you the ability to repeat any given week of the routine in case you miss a workout or two
     Lets you view the history of any exercise you've done to track the progress of your one rep max.

Also, since this is web app, the following features are also present:
             
     Email and password authentication
     Login verification
     Ability to reset password via secure email link
